= Opalia Service SQL

This project is an OSGi component that manages an embedded instance of
https://github.com/h2database/h2database[H2 Database] or manages connectors for some other SQL databases. It provides
an API for a type-safe access to the database via plain SQL.

Download new versions from the Git repository https://github.com/OpaliaSystems/opalia-service-sql.

=== Getting Started

The component is handled by the Service Component Runtime (SCR) and becomes automatically available when all
dependencies are resolved. Once the component becomes available, a transactional instance can be created from the
database service. All SQL statements should be placed in such a transaction.

[source,scala]
----
val transactional = databaseService.newTransactional()

    transactional.withTransaction {
      implicit executor =>

        Query(
          """
            |CREATE TABLE Person (
            |  id INT NOT NULL,
            |  name VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
            |  counter INT NOT NULL,
            |  extra VARCHAR(120) NULL,
            |  PRIMARY KEY (id),
            |);
          """.stripMargin)
          .execute[IgnoredResult]()
    }
----

==== Configuration

The configuration is done by https://github.com/lightbend/config[HOCON]. Examples are available in directory
./testing/src/test/resources/ to get a quick insight into supported operations.

==== Executing a query

If the SQL query needs dynamic parameters, these can be added by declaring placeholders like {this} inside the
query clause. Each parameter is assigned to a value with the 'on' function. The execution returns with a 'Result'
object, which needs to be transformed. This object provides some meta data about the execution of the query.

[source,scala]
----
  Query(
    """
      |SELECT P1.name AS name, P1.counter AS counter
      |FROM Person P1
      |WHERE P1.counter > ? AND P1.extra = ?;
    """.stripMargin)
    .on("1", 42)
    .on("2", "foo")
    .execute[IndexedSeqResult]()
    .transform(row => (row[String]("name"), row[Int]("counter")))
----

The result of a query is designed as a table with rows and columns. Choose a concrete 'Result' type to get the
correct quantity of rows.

[source,scala]
----
// #M = 0
myQuery
.execute[IgnoredResult]()

// #M = 1
val x: String =
  myQuery
    .execute[SingleResult]()
    .transform(row => row[String]("name"))

// #M = 0..1
val x: Option[String] =
  myQuery
    .execute[SingleOptResult]()
    .transform(row => row[String]("name"))

// #M = 0..N
val x: IndexedSeq[String] =
  myQuery
    .execute[IndexedSeqResult]()
    .transform(row => row[String]("name"))

// #M = 1..N
val x: IndexedSeq[String] =
  myQuery
    .execute[IndexedNonEmptySeqResult]()
    .transform(row => row[String]("name"))
----

The API comes with many mappers to handle native Java types and some common types. Additional mappers for custom types
can be easily added.
